@file cliCreator readme
@author Joe Balough

This folder contains a shell script that will generate a v1 zbe datafile.
The description of the data in that file can be found on the wiki here:
http://sites.google.com/site/zoidbergengine/documentation/zeg-datafile/zbe-v-1-0

To use this script, drop all the graphics files you want into gfx and make
sure they have a grit file with them. Things to note: They need to be tiled (-gt),
have a bit depth of 16 (for now) (-gB4), and THEY MUST OUTPUT to a BINARY file (-ftb).
Also note that these files will lose all names associated with them and are assigned
an id based on alphabetical order of the files so name them with an id prefix 
(i.e. 00-first.png, 01-second.png). Also note that there CANNOT be any spaces in that
filename.

After you have your graphics data in there, open up a bash shell in the
cliCreator directory and simply run the script
 $./process_all.sh [out name]
If you don't specify [out name] it will create a file called assets.zbe.
The shell script will run grit on all the graphics in the gfx folder and use
the numPrefix programs to prefix them with lengths.

The numPrefix programs serve only one purpose: take a filename and a number
and prepend that number to the start of the binary in the file. It does that
by writing the number to the output file then copying the data from the input
file after that number.
